Compile/run:
    1. If you haven't already, download Python3 on your system
    2. Go to your Terminal and enter the directory containing MontyHall.py
    3. Run this command in your terminal (w/o quotes): "python3 MontyHall.py"

Program Purpose:
    This program is a simulation of the Monty Hall Problem, with the ability to
    play the game manually or simulate a bunch of games. It aligns with how the
    original game was played in Letâ€™s Make a Deal for decades, and thus there
    are certain strategies that work better than others. There are options to
    either play the game yourself or simulate a set of games. In both modes,
    you are able to modify the game so that there are a different number of
    doors. In the play mode, you get to actually participate in the game,
    trying to guess which door has the car behind it. In the simulation mode,
    you can input the number of simulated games you want to run, and it will
    return statistics for four different strategies, showing which ones worked
    best in that given number of simulations. The strategies I chose to use in
    the simulation mode were:
        1. Stay-stay-...-stay strategy: Banks on you correctly guessing the
           door with the car behind it on the first try. This strategy is just
           awful.
        2. Switch-switch-...-switch strategy: Banks on the luck of your
           indecisiveness.
        3. Stay-stay-...-stay-switch strategy: This is the optimal strategy
           given the rules of the game.
        4. Random Staying/Switching: I just wanted to see how it would do.
	Have fun with the game and simulation! Be sure to try larger numbers with
	the simulation and smaller door numbers with the game (the play mode in the
	game gets a bit repetitive if there are >5 doors).
